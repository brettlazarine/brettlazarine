# Howdy, I'm Brett Lazarine
I've spent the last few years working in .NET, primarily the Blazor and MAUI frameworks.
Recently, I've been spending a lot of time sharpening my skills in back-end technologies, in particular Go.

If I'm not working on a bug or feature for Valour, I'm taking courses and learning new skills and techs.

My current personal project is a Mobile App that acts as the entertainment system for classic cars, that communicates directly with a custom CPU made on a Raspberry Pi with Go.
You can get a look at the progress for those here:

This is something I'm incredibly excited to share and build. 
More updates to come!
